This paper revisits Faulhaber-type identities for odd powers, inspired by Knuthâ€™s exposition on power sums.
Focusing on central factorial numbers and binomial representations, we derive and analyze
an unexpected identity for $n^3$ involving finite differences and triangular numbers.
By reformulating cube identities through nested summations and symmetric expressions like
$\sum_{k=1}^n 6k(n-k) + 1$, we generalize to arbitrary odd powers $n^{2m+1}$
using real coefficients $A_{m,r}$ in the form $\sum_{k=1}^n A_{m,r} k^r(n-k)^r$.
A table of these coefficients is provided, raising questions about their origin, recurrence,
and whether such expressions admit interpretation as a form of polynomial interpolation.
